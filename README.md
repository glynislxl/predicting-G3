# About
This repository contains all the Jupyter Notebooks, dataset, video presentation and the source materials/references we have used and created as part of the Mini Project.

This README breifly highlights what we have accomplished in the project. If you want a more detailed explanation of things, please refer to the Jupyter Notebooks in this repository. They contain more in-depth descriptions and smaller details which are not mentioned here in the README. For convenience, we have divided the notenooks into smaller parts.

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on predicting G3 score from various predictors. For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:
1. [Cleaning the dataset](#cleaning-the-dataset)
2. [Exploratory Data Analysis on numeric variables](#exploratory-data-analysis-on-numeric-variables)
3. [Exploratory Data Analysis on categorical variables](#exploratory-data-analysis-on-categorical-variables)
4. [Predictive modeling using Random tree forest](#predictive-modeling-using-random-tree-forest)
